        <p>CAPTAIN. But no women are born of men. Yes, but I am Bertha's father. Tell me, Margret, don't you believe it? Don't you?</p>

        <p>NURSE. Lord, how silly you are. Of course you are your own child's father. Come and eat now, and don't sit there and sulk. There, there, come now.</p>  

        <p>CAPTAIN. Get out, woman. To hell with the hags. [Goes to private door.] Svärd, Svärd!</p> 

        <p>[Orderly comes in.]</p>

        <p>ORDERLY. Yes, Captain.</p>

        <p>CAPTAIN. Hitch into the covered sleigh at once.</p>

        <p>NURSE. Captain, listen to me.</p>

        <p>CAPTAIN. Out, woman! At once!</p>

        <p>LAURA [Coming in from inner room.] Will you be kind enough—</p>

        <p> CAPTAIN. Just a moment! Sixty-six—seventy-one, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-two, a hundred. What is it?</p>
            
        <p>LAURA. Am I disturbing you?</p>
            
        <p>CAPTAIN. Not at all. Housekeeping money, I suppose?</p>
            
        <p>LAURA. Yes, housekeeping money.</p>
            
        <p>CAPTAIN. Put the accounts down there and I will go over them.</p>
            
        <p>LAURA. The accounts?</p>
            
        <p>CAPTAIN. Yes.</p>
            
        <p>LAURA. Am I to keep accounts now?</p>
            
        <p>CAPTAIN. Of course you are to keep accounts. Our affairs are in a precarious condition, and in case of a liquidation, accounts are necessary, or one is liable to punishment for being careless.</p>
            
        <p>LAURA. It's not my fault that our affairs are in a precarious condition.</p>
